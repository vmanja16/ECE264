   Testing List_merge(lhs, rhs, compar), where:
   
   + compar is: return strcmp(a, b)
   + lhs is: "2" ==> "3" ==> "5" ==> "7" ==> NULL
   + rhs is: "11" ==> "13" ==> "17" ==> "19" ==> "23" ==> NULL
   
   merged is  : NULL
   solution is: "11" ==> "13" ==> "17" ==> "19" ==> "2" ==> "23" ==> "3" ==> "5" ==> "7" ==> NULL
