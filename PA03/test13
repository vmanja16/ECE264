   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Welcome to the PA03 testing program. This program takes a _long_ time
   to execute. There is a reason for this. You should not rely on this
   program to test your code as you go. Instead, you should think about
   what your code should be doing, and what inputs should produce what
   outputs for each of your functions.
   
        YOU SHOULD THEN TEST EVERY PIECE OF CODE AS YOU WRITE IT 
   
                                 AND 
   
                        FIX MISTAKES AS YOU GO.
   
   When you are convinced that you have the entire assignment 100%% correct,
   then you can use this testing program to test it. 
   
   This will give you your mark assuming that you submit it correctly, and 
   there are no other irregularities.
